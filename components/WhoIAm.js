          Thanks for checking out my page! My full name is Noah Vandervelden but
          I usually shorten it to Vandy so it's easier for people to remember
          ðŸ¤·. I am currently a student at Grand Canyon University studying
          software development, and have been developing for about two years,
          with two different internships.
